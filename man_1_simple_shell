.SH NAME
Simple Shell - command language interpreter

.SH SYNOPSIS
#include "shell.h"
./hsh

.SH DESCRIPTION
The Simple Shell is a basic command language interpreter that processes commands read from standard input.
It provides limited shell functionality, including executing commands with arguments, handling environmental
variables, and exiting the shell. The Simple Shell does not yet support advanced features like piping, redirections,
pattern matching, or variable expansions.

.SS INVOCATION
.IP Interactive
To invoke Simple Shell in interactive mode, type ./hsh.

.IP Non-Interactive
To invoke Simple Shell in non-interactive mode, use a pipe (e.g., echo "/bin/ls" | ./hsh).

.SS COMMAND EXECUTION
When a command has been divided into words, resulting in a simple command with an optional list of arguments,
the following actions are performed:

/bin/ls

.IP [[flags]...[arguments]]
Lists files in the current directory based on the user-provided flags.

.SS SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS
.IP "env"
Displays the environmental variables.
.IP "exit"
Exits the Simple Shell and returns to the original user shell.

.SH BUGS
No known bugs.
